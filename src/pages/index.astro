An Astro website can go way beyond static pages - on the right platform.

Netlify supports not only [Streaming SSR](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#html-streaming) and fast [Edge Middleware](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/), but also [on-demand revalidation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/cache-tags-and-purge-api-on-netlify/) and [stale-while-revalidate](https://www.netlify.com/blog/swr-and-fine-grained-cache-control/). 
Any page or data can be rebuilt only when needed, without site visitors ever getting a performance hit.
